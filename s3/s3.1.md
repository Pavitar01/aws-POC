### **📦 AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) Overview**  

AWS **S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is a cloud storage service that allows you to store and retrieve **unlimited data**. However, there are **limits per AWS account**, such as a **maximum of 100 buckets** per account by default.

### **🛠️ Structure of S3**  

1️⃣ **Buckets** → The highest-level container in S3 (like a drive).  
   - Each AWS account can have **up to 100 buckets** by default.  
   - Bucket names must be **globally unique** across all AWS users.  

2️⃣ **Objects** → The actual files (data) stored in S3.  
   - Objects can be any type of file (images, videos, documents, backups, etc.).  
   - Each object has **metadata** (info about the object like size, type, owner).  

3️⃣ **Folders (Prefixes)** → S3 does **not** have real folders; instead, it **uses prefixes** to simulate a folder structure.  
   - Example:  
     - `my-bucket/folder1/folder2/image.jpg`  
     - It looks like folders, but it's just an object with a long key name.

### **📏 Storage Limit & Size**  
✅ **Unlimited Storage** → You can store **as much data as you need**.  
✅ **Max Object Size** → **5TB per object** (individual file).  
✅ **Upload Limit** → **5GB max per single upload**, but **Multipart Upload** supports larger files.

### **🔑 Key Features of S3**  

🔹 **Durability & Availability** → S3 offers **99.999999999% (11 nines) durability**, meaning your data is **highly secure**.  
🔹 **Access Control** → You can set **public or private access** to your bucket and objects.  
🔹 **Lifecycle Rules** → Automatically move files to different storage classes (e.g., Glacier for cost-saving).  
🔹 **Versioning** → Keeps multiple versions of a file to prevent accidental data loss.

### **💰 S3 Pricing**  
- Charges are based on:  
  ✅ **Storage Used** (GB stored per month)  
  ✅ **Requests & Access** (PUT, GET, DELETE)  
  ✅ **Data Transfer** (moving data outside AWS may cost extra)

### **📌 Summary**  
- **S3 allows unlimited storage, but you are limited to 100 buckets per account.**  
- **Objects are stored in a "bucket > prefix > object" format.**  
- **S3 storage is highly scalable, durable, and secure.**  
- **Costs depend on storage, requests, and data transfer.**  

🚀 **S3 is widely used for backups, media storage, data lakes, and static website hosting!**
