### **📌 AWS CloudTrail: Understanding Its Role & Benefits**  

**AWS CloudTrail** is a service that **logs and tracks all API requests** made in your AWS account. It provides visibility into who did what, when, and from where. This is crucial for **security, auditing, and compliance**.  

---

### **🛠️ What Does CloudTrail Do?**
1. **Tracks all AWS API activity**  
   - Every action in AWS (via Console, SDK, CLI) is recorded.  
2. **Logs API requests as events**  
   - Who accessed what resources and when?  
3. **Stores logs in Amazon S3**  
   - By default, logs are stored for **90 days**, but you can keep them longer in S3.  
4. **Integrates with CloudWatch**  
   - Helps in real-time monitoring and setting up alerts.  
5. **Supports security audits**  
   - Helps track unauthorized or suspicious activities.

### **📂 CloudTrail Components**
1. **Event** – A record of an API call (e.g., S3 bucket creation, EC2 start/stop).  
2. **Trail** – A configuration that **stores** logs in S3 or CloudWatch.  
3. **Event History** – The last **90 days** of events (default storage).  
4. **Data Events** – Track **object-level** actions (e.g., `PutObject`, `GetObject` in S3).  
5. **Management Events** – Logs changes to AWS resources (e.g., creating/deleting IAM roles).
