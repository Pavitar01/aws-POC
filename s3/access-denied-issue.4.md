### **🛑 Why Are My S3 Objects Not Showing? (Access Denied Issue)**  

If your S3 object is **not visible** and you see an **"Access Denied"** error, it is because:  
✅ Your **S3 bucket blocks public access by default**  
✅ The **IAM user or bucket policy does not allow public reads**  

To **fix this issue**, follow these steps:  

---

### **🔓 Step 1: Enable Public Access for Your Bucket**  
1️⃣ Go to **AWS Management Console** → **S3**  
2️⃣ Click on your **bucket name**  
3️⃣ Go to the **Permissions** tab  
4️⃣ Scroll down to **Block public access (bucket settings)**  
5️⃣ Click **Edit**  
6️⃣ **Uncheck** "Block all public access" ✅  
7️⃣ Click **Save changes**  

---

### **📜 Step 2: Add a Bucket Policy for Public Read Access**  
1️⃣ In your **S3 bucket**, go to the **Permissions** tab  
2️⃣ Scroll to **Bucket Policy** and click **Edit**  
3️⃣ Copy and paste this policy (replace `[yourbucketname]` with your actual bucket name):  

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::[yourbucketname]/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

4️⃣ Click **Save changes**  

---

### **✅ Step 3: Test Your Object’s Public Access**  
1️⃣ Go to the **Objects** tab in your S3 bucket  
2️⃣ Click on an uploaded object  
3️⃣ Copy the **Object URL**  
4️⃣ Paste it in your browser – it should now be **publicly accessible**! 🎉  

---

Now, your **S3 objects are accessible to anyone** via a public URL. 🚀
