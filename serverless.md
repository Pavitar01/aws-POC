# **🚀 Understanding Serverless with AWS Lambda**  

## **What is Serverless?**  
Serverless means you **only write the code**, and AWS handles everything else, including:  
✅ Servers 🚀  
✅ Operating System 🖥️  
✅ RAM & Storage 💾  
✅ Scaling 📈  
✅ Deployment ⚡  

You **don’t pay** when your code is not running! 💰

## **How AWS Lambda Works**  
1️⃣ **User visits your website → AWS starts your function.**  
2️⃣ **Function runs line by line and returns a response.**  
3️⃣ **After execution, AWS shuts it down to save cost.**  
4️⃣ **If 1000 users visit, AWS creates 1000 instances.**  

No need to **manually scale**—AWS does it **automatically**! 🔄

## **Costing in Serverless**  
💵 **You only pay when your function runs!**  

- **Per Invocation Charge** → Each time your function runs, AWS bills you.  
- **Execution Time Charge** → You pay for how long the function runs (**per millisecond**).  
- **Cold Start Delay** → If no one visits for a while, the function "sleeps" and takes extra time to start.  
- **Scaling Cost** → More users = More function instances = More cost.  

✅ **AWS gives 1 million free requests per month!** 🎉

## **Optimizing for Lower Costs**  
🔹 Reduce code size (smaller = faster).  
🔹 Use efficient logic (avoid unnecessary loops).  
🔹 Choose a faster runtime (Node.js > Python > Java).  
🔹 Set a lower timeout (default is **15s**, but you can reduce it).

✅ **Only pay for what you use** 💰  
✅ **Automatic scaling** 📈  
✅ **Faster development & deployment** 🚀
