When you stop and restart an EC2 instance, the **public IP changes**. To have a **static IP**, we need to assign an **Elastic IP (EIP)**. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Go to AWS EC2 Dashboard**  
- In the **AWS Console**, navigate to **EC2**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Allocate a New Elastic IP**  
- Click on **Allocate Elastic IP address**.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Associate the Elastic IP with Your EC2 Instance**  
- Select the newly created **Elastic IP**.  
- Click **Actions ‚Üí Associate Elastic IP address**.  
- Select:  
  - **Instance**: Choose your running EC2 instance.  
  - **Private IP**: Leave default.  
- Click **Associate**.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Verify Your Static IP**  
- Go to **EC2 Instances** ‚Üí Select your instance.

### **Important Notes**
‚úÖ **Elastic IPs are free as long as they are associated with a running instance**.  
üö® **If you don‚Äôt use the Elastic IP, AWS charges you for it**. So, if not needed, **release it** to avoid extra costs.  

Would you like help setting up a **domain** (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) with this Elastic IP? üåç
